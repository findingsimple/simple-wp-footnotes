This plugin allows users to easily insert footnotes within post/page content. Footnotes 
are automatically converted to superscript numbers and linked to the appropriate note 
appended to your post/page content.

* **Shortcode** Manually insert footnotes using the [footnote] shortcode.
* **Buttons** Alternatively the footnotess can be inserted within the viusal editor with a 
TinyMCE button and in the HTML editor with a quicktag button.
* **Paginated Posts/Pages** Works for paginated posts/posts and provides option to display
either before or after the page links.

plugin css/js - these can be disabled through the settings and you can combine with your
existing stylesheets and scripts manually.
